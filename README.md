## Current features

1. Boot configuration in an intuitive user interface
2. Drag and drop enabled plugin GUI for adding, removing, activating and deactivating plugins
3. Timed events. A great tool for automating announcements and events without the need of extra plugins
4. Realtime monitoring of logs. Look at the logs directly in the app at any given time in realtime
5. Player moderation. kick, kill, ban/unban, make moderator, remove moderator privileges
6. Itembrowser. Give players items and blueprints through the integrated itembrowser
7. Realtime monitoring of chat messages

## Motivation

What got this project started was the tiredness of those pesky bat files and the desire of a intuitive user interface for managing Oxide powered Rust servers
